abstract = {Reservoir construction and the introduction of nonnative species are major anthropogenic drivers of biotic change in freshwater ecosystems. To understand the influence of these drivers, we quantified the degree to which fish faunas have either homogenized or differentiated at multiple spatial scales across the Great Plains—Rocky Mountain continuum (Wyoming, USA), given that homogenization processes are scale-dependent. Homogenization was most prevalent at the largest scale, with an average increase in similarity of 6.8% among river basins. At an intermediate scale, sub-basins with reservoirs had homogenized faunas in comparison to sub-basins without reservoirs, which were more differentiated. Differentiation was dominant at the smallest scale with a 7.8% average decrease in similarity among individual sampling sites. Reservoirs had only localized homogenization impacts along stream systems, and homogenization was greater for streams connected to large reservoirs. Large-sized streams appeared to trend towards homogenization, whereas small and medium streams trended towards differentiation. Reservoirs altered fish faunas from historical conditions, but did not result in cross-stream homogenization because of the idiosyncratic nature of reservoir introductions that reflect environmental gradients and socio-economic factors. Our results provide insight into how spatial scale, reservoirs, and nonnative species interact to influence the degree of homogenization and differentiation.},

abstract = {Nonnative fish can have substantial negative effects on the abundance and distribution of native fishes through predation and competition. Nonnative predators are of particular interest because they represent novel threats to native prey species that are not adapted to their presence. Prey species with limited distributions or population sizes may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of nonnative predators. In the Laramie River, four nonnative predators—Brown Trout Salmo trutta, Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu are present along with a state-imperiled population of Hornyhead Chub Nocomis biguttatus. The abundance of Hornyhead Chub has declined with increasing abundance of nonnative predators, with the probability of occurrence of Hornyhead Chub dropping drastically when Smallmouth Bass were present. All four nonnative species preyed on native cyprinids, but Smallmouth Bass relied most heavily on fish as a prey item. Isotopic niche overlap occurred between Hornyhead Chub and all of the nonnative predator species. Our results demonstrate that nonnative predators have the potential to negatively affect the abundance and distribution of Hornyhead Chub through the mechanisms of predation and competition, and predator identity is important in determining the extent of effects. Smallmouth Bass are a greater concern than nonnative salmonids because of their more piscivorous behavior, and their recent upstream expansion may be limiting the downstream distribution of Hornyhead Chub in the Laramie River.},

abstract = {Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly fishes. Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change − critical information for conservation planning − are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically downscaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041–2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with > 50% of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species.},

abstract = {Food web investigations using stable isotope analyses inform management strategies by quantitatively describing interactions among species. Fin tissue is a nonlethal alternative to white muscle tissue for obtaining stable isotope ratios of fish. However, the relationship between fin and muscle values must be evaluated before fin tissue can be substituted for muscle tissue. We examined the relationships between fin and muscle carbon (<i>$\delta$</i><sup>13</sup>C) and nitrogen (<i>$\delta$</i><sup>15</sup>N) isotope ratios in 15 species of North American freshwater fish using linear regression for multi‐species models and species‐specific models and compared the performance of our models against models developed for European and Australian freshwater fishes. Fin and muscle isotope ratios differed but covaried with good explanatory power (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>$\delta$</sub></i><sup>13</sup><sub>C</sub> = 0.74 – 0.99, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>$\delta$</sub></i><sup>15</sup><i><sub>N</sub></i> = 0.45 – 0.99). Useful conversions of fin isotope values were provided by our species‐specific models (<i>$\delta$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.27‰, <i>$\delta$<sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub></i> = 0.22‰), and to a lesser extent our multi‐species models (<i>$\delta$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.51‰, $\delta$<sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub> = 0.35‰) and the European models (<i>$\delta$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.57‰, <i>$\delta$</i><sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub> = 0.42‰). Models developed for Australian fishes gave less precise conversions when applied to North American freshwater species (<i>$\delta$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.78‰, <i>$\delta$</i><sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub> = 0.82‰). We recommend using species‐specific conversion models when available, but in their absence, multi‐species models may be adequate. Our study contributes to a growing literature seeking fin‐muscle conversion models that should serve to reduce the lethal take of individuals.},
