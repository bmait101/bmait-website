## Teaching Philosophy

â€‹Teaching and mentoring are important and rewarding components of my work for two primary reasons. First, I am dedicated to the development of future generations of problem-solvers and leaders. We are in a time when science literacy and science-based decision-making are increasingly necessary for the conservation of biological diversity and human wellbeing. Second, teaching has helped refine my own understanding of basic biological and ecological principles, which in turn has helped me refine my own research questions and contextualize that work within the bigger picture. Thus, my goal as a teacher is to prepare students to be professionals that evaluate ideas based on evidence so they can apply that knowledge to the real world. As a lifelong student myself, I also look forward to pursuing professional development opportunities on pedagogy through online and on-campus programs.
