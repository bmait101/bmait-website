My goal as a teacher and educator is to prepare students to be diverse professionals that evaluate ideas based on evidence and apply that knowledge to address the wicked challenges facing society today.

### Accomplishments

In addition to being the primary TA for the University of Wyoming’s Ichthyology course, as well as a Curatorial Assistant in the University of Wyoming Museum of Vertebrates’ Ichthyology Collection, I was also the Ichthyology instructor of record in 2020. I have been an invited guest lecturer for several University of Wyoming courses, including General Ecology, Limnology, Stable Isotope Ecology, and Fisheries Management. I also developed a ½ day workshop on Isotope Mixing Models for students at the University of Wyoming. As a graduate student, I acquired 12 semesters of teaching experience teaching three different undergraduate courses: Wildlife and Fisheries Management (U Alberta), Ichthyology (UWyo), and Fisheries Management (UWyo). I consistently received strong student evaluations in these roles. Further, I have provided several graduate students and state agency staff with assistance on statistical analysis and data visualization using R, and recently was invited to teach the Aquatic Ecology section for the 2021 Wyoming Naturalist Program curriculum.
