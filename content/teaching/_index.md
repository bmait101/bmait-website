## Teaching philosophy

Teaching is an important and rewarding component of my work for two primary reasons. First, I want to help train future generations of problem solvers because science literacy and science based decision making are increasingly necessary for the conservation of ecological and human health. Second, teaching has helped refine my own understanding of the world, which in turn has helped me refine my own research questions and contextualize that work within the bigger picture. Thus, my goal as a teacher is to prepare students to be diverse professionals that evaluate ideas based on evidence and apply that knowledge to address the wicked challenges facing society today.

### Accomplishments

In addition to being the primary TA for the University of Wyoming’s Ichthyology course, as well as a Curatorial Assistant in the University of Wyoming Museum of Vertebrates’ Ichthyology Collection, I was also the Ichthyology instructor of record in 2020. I have been an invited guest lecturer for several University of Wyoming courses, including General Ecology, Limnology, Stable Isotope Ecology, and Fisheries Management. I also developed a ½ day workshop on Isotope Mixing Models for students at the University of Wyoming. As a graduate student, I acquired 12 semesters of teaching experience teaching three different undergraduate courses: Wildlife and Fisheries Management (U Alberta), Ichthyology (UWyo), and Fisheries Management (UWyo). I consistently received strong student evaluations in these roles. Further, I have provided several graduate students and state agency staff with assistance on statistical analysis and data visualization using R, and recently was invited to teach the Aquatic Ecology section for the 2021 Wyoming Naturalist Program curriculum. 


## Mentoring philosophy

It is an undeniable privilege to pursue something you love. I have worked very hard to be able to think deeply about how nature works—to spend hours or days or weeks working outdoors on magnificent creatures in wonderful places. Put simply: I believe the world is your oyster. But such privilege requires enthusiasm, dedication, and passion. And the passion is critical: you must love what you are doing! So, my overarching philosophy as a mentor is just that: undergraduate and graduate school, and research in general, is hard work, but it should be fun too.
