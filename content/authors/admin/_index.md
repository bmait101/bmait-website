I am an aquatic conservation ecologist who researches the mechanisms promoting and threatening freshwater species persistence. I am interested in applying ecological data, models, and collaborative science to advance fundamental knowledge and develop actionable solutions to real-world problems. I use statistical modeling, biochemical proxies like stable isotopes, and field work to answer my research questions. I obtained my PhD under Dr. Frank Rahel at the University of Wyoming in August 2020. 

Currently, I am a Wisconsin Water Resources Science-Policy Fellow working at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources on a project trying to untangle the effects of hydrologic change on stream trout populations. Using field data and models, we are working to evaluate the potential impacts of extreme weather events, climate warming, and groundwater withdrawals on Brook and Brown Trout across Wisconsin. 

Beyond research, I am dedicated to doing my best to train and mentor tomorrow's problem solvers and ecologists. I enjoy participating in scientific outreach, as well as learning how to become a better communicator. I have a passion for the outdoors and being near water, and can usually be found streamside with my dog, Brook.
