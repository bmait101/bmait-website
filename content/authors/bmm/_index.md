I am a Research Fish Biologist in the [Water and Watersheds Program](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/rmrs/programs/waterwatersheds) at the U.S. Forest Service [Rocky Mountain Research Station](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/rmrs) working out of Boise, ID. I enjoy linking theory with big data, and I strive to address pressing ecological and conservation questions while remaining grounded in empiricism. I also have long-standing professional and personal interests in the ecology, conservation, and natural history of fishes.
