I am a quantitative ecologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with broad research interests in community dynamics and structure, food web interactions, and conservation biology. I enjoy linking theory with data, and I strive to address pressing ecological and conservation questions while remaining grounded in empiricism. I also have long-standing professional and personal interests in the ecology, conservation, and natural history of fishes.
