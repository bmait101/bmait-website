I am a Wisconsin Water Resources Science-Policy Postdoctoral Fellow co-appointed between the [University of Wisconsin-Madison's](https://www.wisc.edu/) [Aquatic Sciences Center](https://aqua.wisc.edu/) and the [Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/). I completed three postgraduate degrees in ecology (BS, MSc, PhD) from universities in the USA and Canada. I work as both a pure and an applied ecologist and I am particularly keen on working at the interface between the two disciplines. 

My mission is to advance the science and practice of conserving freshwater ecosystems. As an ecologist, I study the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems in response to environmental change. My aim is to integrate science-based approaches with on-the-ground management decisions. I also actively engage in science communication and community science efforts.
