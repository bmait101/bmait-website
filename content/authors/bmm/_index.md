I am a conservation ecologist interested in applying collaborative science to advance fundamental knowledge and develop actionable solutions to real-world problems. I got my PhD at the University of Wyoming, advised by Dr. Frank Rahel. My dissertation focused on using ecological models and stable isotopes to investigate broad-scale patterns of aquatic food webs and fish communities.

Currently, I am a Wisconsin Water Resources Science-Policy Fellow working at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources on a project working to untangle the effects of climate change on stream trout populations. Using field data and a variety of models, we evaluating the potential impacts of extreme weather events, warming, and groundwater withdrawals on Brook and Brown Trout across Wisconsin. 

Beyond research, I am dedicated to doing my best to train and mentor tomorrow's problem solvers. I enjoy participating in scientific outreach, as well as learning how to become a better communicator. I have a passion for the outdoors and being near water, and can usually be found stream-side with my dog, Brook.
