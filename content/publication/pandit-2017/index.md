abstract: Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly fishes.
  Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species
  with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn,
  this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats,
  leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current
  extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and
  their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change − critical information
  for conservation planning − are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus)
  is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally
  (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range
  and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine
  the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat
  for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN
  models). Statistically downscaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs)
  data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America
  for the period of 2041–2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature
  variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns
  of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current
  distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with > 50% of the current distribution
  changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways
  for CO2emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable
  for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further
  north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner
  would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting
  current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These
  results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming
  climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be
  needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence
  of the species.
