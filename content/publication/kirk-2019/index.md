abstract: Reservoir construction and the introduction of nonnative species are major
  anthropogenic drivers of biotic change in freshwater ecosystems. To understand the
  influence of these drivers, we quantified the degree to which fish faunas have either
  homogenized or differentiated at multiple spatial scales across the Great Plains—Rocky
  Mountain continuum (Wyoming, USA), given that homogenization processes are scale-dependent.
  Homogenization was most prevalent at the largest scale, with an average increase
  in similarity of 6.8% among river basins. At an intermediate scale, sub-basins with
  reservoirs had homogenized faunas in comparison to sub-basins without reservoirs,
  which were more differentiated. Differentiation was dominant at the smallest scale
  with a 7.8% average decrease in similarity among individual sampling sites. Reservoirs
  had only localized homogenization impacts along stream systems, and homogenization
  was greater for streams connected to large reservoirs. Large-sized streams appeared
  to trend towards homogenization, whereas small and medium streams trended towards
  differentiation. Reservoirs altered fish faunas from historical conditions, but
  did not result in cross-stream homogenization because of the idiosyncratic nature
  of reservoir introductions that reflect environmental gradients and socio-economic
  factors. Our results provide insight into how spatial scale, reservoirs, and nonnative
  species interact to influence the degree of homogenization and differentiation.
