 abstract = {Food web investigations using stable isotope analyses inform management strategies by quantitatively describing interactions among species. Fin tissue is a nonlethal alternative to white muscle tissue for obtaining stable isotope ratios of fish. However, the relationship between fin and muscle values must be evaluated before fin tissue can be substituted for muscle tissue. We examined the relationships between fin and muscle carbon (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C) and nitrogen (<i>$δ$</i><sup>15</sup>N) isotope ratios in 15 species of North American freshwater fish using linear regression for multi‐species models and species‐specific models and compared the performance of our models against models developed for European and Australian freshwater fishes. Fin and muscle isotope ratios differed but covaried with good explanatory power (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>$δ$</sub></i><sup>13</sup><sub>C</sub> = 0.74 – 0.99, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>$δ$</sub></i><sup>15</sup><i><sub>N</sub></i> = 0.45 – 0.99). Useful conversions of fin isotope values were provided by our species‐specific models (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.27‰, <i>$δ$<sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub></i> = 0.22‰), and to a lesser extent our multi‐species models (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.51‰, $δ$<sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub> = 0.35‰) and the European models (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.57‰, <i>$δ$</i><sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub> = 0.42‰). Models developed for Australian fishes gave less precise conversions when applied to North American freshwater species (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.78‰, <i>$δ$</i><sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub> = 0.82‰). We recommend using species‐specific conversion models when available, but in their absence, multi‐species models may be adequate. Our study contributes to a growing literature seeking fin‐muscle conversion models that should serve to reduce the lethal take of individuals.},
