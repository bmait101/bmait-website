abstract: Food web investigations using stable isotope analyses inform management
  strategies by quantitatively describing interactions among species. Fin tissue is
  a nonlethal alternative to white muscle tissue for obtaining stable isotope ratios
  of fish. However, the relationship between fin and muscle values must be evaluated
  before fin tissue can be substituted for muscle tissue. We examined the relationships
  between fin and muscle carbon (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C) and nitrogen (<i>$δ$</i><sup>15</sup>N)
  isotope ratios in 15 species of North American freshwater fish using linear regression
  for multi‐species models and species‐specific models and compared the performance
  of our models against models developed for European and Australian freshwater fishes.
  Fin and muscle isotope ratios differed but covaried with good explanatory power
  (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>$δ$</sub></i><sup>13</sup><sub>C</sub> = 0.74 – 0.99,
  <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>$δ$</sub></i><sup>15</sup><i><sub>N</sub></i> = 0.45
  – 0.99). Useful conversions of fin isotope values were provided by our species‐specific
  models (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.27‰, <i>$δ$<sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub></i>
  = 0.22‰), and to a lesser extent our multi‐species models (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub>
  = 0.51‰, $δ$<sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub> = 0.35‰) and the European models (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub>
  = 0.57‰, <i>$δ$</i><sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub> = 0.42‰). Models developed for
  Australian fishes gave less precise conversions when applied to North American freshwater
  species (<i>$δ$</i><sup>13</sup>C<sub>error</sub> = 0.78‰, <i>$δ$</i><sup>15</sup>N<sub>error</sub>
  = 0.82‰). We recommend using species‐specific conversion models when available,
  but in their absence, multi‐species models may be adequate. Our study contributes
  to a growing literature seeking fin‐muscle conversion models that should serve to
  reduce the lethal take of individuals.
