abstract: Nonnative fish can have substantial negative effects on the abundance and
  distribution of native fishes through predation and competition. Nonnative predators
  are of particular interest because they represent novel threats to native prey species
  that are not adapted to their presence. Prey species with limited distributions
  or population sizes may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of nonnative predators.
  In the Laramie River, four nonnative predatorsâ€”Brown Trout Salmo trutta, Rainbow
  Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and Smallmouth Bass
  Micropterus dolomieu are present along with a state-imperiled population of Hornyhead
  Chub Nocomis biguttatus. The abundance of Hornyhead Chub has declined with increasing
  abundance of nonnative predators, with the probability of occurrence of Hornyhead
  Chub dropping drastically when Smallmouth Bass were present. All four nonnative
  species preyed on native cyprinids, but Smallmouth Bass relied most heavily on fish
  as a prey item. Isotopic niche overlap occurred between Hornyhead Chub and all of
  the nonnative predator species. Our results demonstrate that nonnative predators
  have the potential to negatively affect the abundance and distribution of Hornyhead
  Chub through the mechanisms of predation and competition, and predator identity
  is important in determining the extent of effects. Smallmouth Bass are a greater
  concern than nonnative salmonids because of their more piscivorous behavior, and
  their recent upstream expansion may be limiting the downstream distribution of Hornyhead
  Chub in the Laramie River.
