I'm a quantitative ecologist with broad research interests. My primary interests are conservation biology (science and implementation at local to regional scales), community ecology (freshwater fishes, invertebrates), food web ecology (niche variation and stable isotopes) ecohydrology (environmental flows, groundwater management), and climate change (impacts and adaptation strategies). My dissertation work in the Rahel lab at the University of Wyoming centered on the environmental and biotic drivers of food web structure and function in streams, and my postdoctoral research at UW-Madison and the WDNR centers on global change of trout populations.

Aside from my ecological research, I also work to ... 

When I'm doing science, I'm usually reading, fishing, biking, or exploring nature with my dog.

## Places

My work has afforded me the privilege of working in some of the most beautiful places in the world.

<br>**Doniminca**, in the [West Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies), was a magical place to explore, and is where I carried out my very first, formal, scientific investigation. It lead to a neat story about a volcanic lake high up on the island the we published in [*Hydrobiologia*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10750-019-04000-7).
