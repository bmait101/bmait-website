We live in unprecedented times: big data, rapidly improving analytical tools and computing power, and long-term monitoring programs are enabling researchers to answer previously unanswerable questions. I use these tools to understand the mechanisms that shape ecological processes, then apply that knowledge to conservation practice. A common element spanning my research is an explicit emphasis of using quantitative approaches for data analysis and inference. And I work to co-produce actionable science through start-to-finish engagement with collaborators and stakeholders. 

I do integrative research that spans several fields, including community ecology, physiology, restoration, and global change biology. My research has three primary foci:


### Global Change

### Food Webs

### Macroecology
