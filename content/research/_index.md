<br> 

Freshwater ecosystems provide us with a multitude of services and host remarkable biodiversity. But the health of these systems is declining at a rapid clip from numerous, interacting threats. So my **raison d'Ãªtre** is to understand the future of inland waters in an urbanizing environment and changing climate. To do that, I study how terrestrial and atmospheric changes, such as rising air temperatures and land-use patterns, alter aquatic communities and food web processes. Importantly, I endeavor to co-produce science that is actionable through start-to-finish engagement with collaborators and stakeholders.

Broadly, my research program combines themes from population, community, and landscape ecology, and focuses on the ecology and conservation of fishes (particularly freshwater ones). It also spans spatial scales, from local, single lakes or stream reaches, to watersheds and whole regions. 


### Global change & multiple stressors

Species today face wicked problems such as land-use change, rising air temperatures, non-native species, and emerging contaminants. I am interested in untangling the effects of these multiple stressors to inform policy and guide the prioritization of conservation actions.  

### Food web ecology and species interactions

Ecologists have long searched for structures and processes that impart stability in nature. Food webs have emerged as a central organizing concept in ecology because they 1) link structure and function within ecosystems (e.g., species identity and behavior (foraging) with biogeochemical cycles (matter and energy flow), and 2) bridge levels of biological organization (organism to population and community). I am interested in teasing apart the interplay between top-down (predation) and bottom-up (primary productivity) processes, and in how that interplay can stabilize or destabilize ecological communities and whole ecosystems. 

### Flow regimes

Flow is a keystone variable in flowing water ecosystems. I am interested in how stream hydrology and fish populations respond to climate, water use, and management changes.
