<br> 

Freshwater ecosystems provide us with a multitude of services and host remarkable biodiversity. But the health of these systems is declining at a rapid clip from numerous, interacting threats. 
I am a quantitative ecologist who uses a emerging anlaytical tools and big data to quantify the mechanisms that shape ecological processes, then apply that knowledge to conservation practice. I do integrative research that spans several fields, including conservation biology, population and community ecology, food web ecology, ecohydrology. My research has three primary foci:

---

## **Global change & multiple stressors**

Species today face wicked problems such as land-use change, extreme weather, non-native species, and emerging contaminants. I am working to untangle the effects of multiple stressors to inform policy and guide the prioritization of conservation actions.

## **Food web ecology**

Ecologists have long searched for structures and processes that impart stability in nature. Food webs have emerged as a central organizing concept in ecology because they 1) link structure and function within ecosystems (e.g., species identity and behavior (foraging) with biogeochemical cycles (matter and energy flow), and 2) bridge levels of biological organization (organism to population and community). I am working to understand the interplay between top-down (predation) and bottom-up (primary productivity) processes, and how that interplay can stabilize or destabilize ecological communities and whole ecosystems.

## **Conservation**

Applying ecological research to conserve and restore ecosystems, and the biological communities that inhabit them, is my motivation in life. This works best when we can find win-win situations in which both biodiversity and people benefit. So, much of my work revolves around leveraging ecological research to inform conservation action, which I do by co-producing science that is actionable through start-to-finish engagement with collaborators and stakeholders.
