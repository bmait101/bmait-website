<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20pt;">Freshwater Science in a Changing World</p>

<br> 

Freshwater ecosystems provide us with a multitude of services and host remarkable biodiversity. But the health of these systems is declining at a rapid clip from numerous, interacting threats. So my **raison d'Ãªtre** is to understand the future of inland waters in an urbanizing environment and changing climate. To do that, I study how terrestrial and atmospheric changes, such as rising air temperatures and land-use patterns, alter aquatic communities and food web processes. Importantly, I endeavor to co-produce science that is actionable through start-to-finish engagement with collaborators and stakeholders.

Broadly, my research program combines themes from population, community, and landscape ecology, and focuses on the ecology and conservation of fishes (particularly freshwater ones). It also spans spatial scales, from local, single lake or stream reaches, to watersheds and whole regions.
