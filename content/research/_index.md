## Research philosophy

Realizing conservation and management goals against a backdrop of anthropogenic change is a key natural resource management challenge facing society today. As the climate and associated weather patterns shift, land uses change, and angling pressures mount, there is a heightened urgency to better understand how these emerging threats impact biodiversity and ecosystem function. My research program addresses this grand challenge: it spans multiple levels of biological organization and modes of inquiry to advance the science and practice of conserving ecosystems, with a focus on freshwaters.

My principal interests include conservation biology (science and implementation at local to regional scales), community ecology (freshwater fishes, invertebrates), food web ecology (niche variation and stable isotopes) ecohydrology (environmental flows, groundwater management), and climate change (impacts and adaptation strategies). I draw liberally from theory underpinning modern ecology to develop hypotheses, and I then I test predictions of these hypotheses with a combination of comparative field studies, stable isotope analyses, and large data syntheses. A common element spanning my research is an explicit emphasis of using quantitative approaches for data analysis and inference. And I work to co-produce actionable science through start-to-finish engagement with collaborators and stakeholders.
