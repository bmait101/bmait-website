<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20pt;">Freshwater Conservation Ecology in a Changing World</p>

<br> 

Freshwater ecosystems provide us with a multitude of services and host remarkable biodiversity. But the health of our freshwater ecosystems and animal poulations are declining at a rapid clip from numerous, interacting factors. So, I use a variety of tools to quantify the mechanisms that shape ecological processes, then apply that knowledge to conservation practice. And I strive to co-produce actionable science through start-to-finish engagement with collaborators and stakeholders.

Broadly, my research focuses on the ecology and conservation of fishes (particularly freshwater ones), with and emphasis on responces to global chnage, trophic ecology, and environmental flows.
