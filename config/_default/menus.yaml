# Navigation Links

# To link a homepage widget (section), specify the URL as a hash `#` followed 
# by the filename of the desired widget in your `content/home/` folder.

# The weight parameter defines the order that the links will appear in.
# Here we use multiples of ten so that itâ€™s easier to change the order in the future if we have many menu items.
